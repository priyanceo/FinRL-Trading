## About

**FinRL-X** is a next-generation, **AI-native** quantitative trading infrastructure that redefines how researchers and practitioners build, test, and deploy algorithmic trading strategies. 

Introduced in our paper *"FinRL-X: An AI-Native Modular Infrastructure for Quantitative Trading"* ([arXiv:2603.21330](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.21330)), FinRL-X succeeds the original [FinRL](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL) framework with a fully modernized architecture designed for the LLM and agentic AI era.

> FinRL-X is **not just a library** — it is a full-stack trading platform engineered around modularity, reproducibility, and production-readiness, supporting everything from ML-based stock selection and professional backtesting to live brokerage execution.

At its core is a **weight-centric architecture** — the target portfolio weight vector is the sole interface contract between strategy logic and downstream execution:

$$w_t = \mathcal{R}_t\bigl(\mathcal{T}_t\bigl(\mathcal{A}_t\bigl(\mathcal{S}_t(\mathcal{X}_{\le t})\bigr)\bigr)\bigr)$$

where $\mathcal{S}$ denotes stock selection, $\mathcal{A}$ portfolio allocation, $\mathcal{T}$ timing adjustment, and $\mathcal{R}$ portfolio-level risk overlay. Each transformation is contract-preserving — you can swap any mod
